# timidity-sf2

A fork of [feross/timidity](https://github.com/feross/timidity). Rewritten APIs to target a lower-level experience.

Part of the Glade MediaSource API project, revolutionizing WebMP.

Lead developer note: I hate Node.js, but still have to use it to prevent potential breaks.

## Features

- Lightweight – Just 23 KB of JavaScript and 22 KB of lazy-loaded WebAssembly
- Simple – No bells and whistles. Just what is needed to play MIDI files.
- Low-level - As low as the original glue layer allows us to be. Just like how you would use TiMidity++ on your device.
- No FreePats. Just bring your own SF2 file.
- Or no SF2 file even, just provide your own configuration from scratch?

## Usage

TBD.
